# ☕ Women's mood detector - BertAI Fine Tuning

## Introduction
> This project uses a fine-tuned DistilBERT model to detect women's mood in short chat messages—because mostly men can’t even understand women, so why not let an AI try? Using the MTEB Emotion dataset, the model learns to recognize emotions such as joy, sadness, anger, fear, love, and surprise. The goal is to show that transformer models can spot emotional vibes in text and maybe help digital conversations make a little more sense… even when people don’t.
